# nepal-earthquake-analysis
Exploratory analysis of 35+ years of earthquake data in Nepal focusing on magnitude, depth, spatial distribution, and seismic data quality trends.

# 🌏 Project Overview

This project explores historical seismic activity in Nepal using raw and processed earthquake records from the USGS Earthquake Hazards Program.

The analysis focuses on understanding:

* Earthquake frequency and seasonality

* Magnitude and depth behavior

* Spatial clustering

* Data quality improvements over time

# 📊 Dataset

* Time period: 1990–2026

* Region: Nepal (26–31°N, 80–89°E)

* Source: USGS Earthquake Hazards Program

Includes raw and processed datasets with technical metadata

# 🔍 Analysis Steps

* Data ingestion & datetime processing

* Temporal coverage & frequency analysis

* Seasonal and monthly trends

* Magnitude distribution & depth behavior

* Spatial density and regional clustering

* Data quality analysis (gap, rms, station count)

# 📈 Key Insights

* Most earthquakes in Nepal are shallow (5–25 km)

* Large magnitude events are rare but well recorded

* Earthquake detection quality improves significantly over time

* Some observed trends are influenced by sensor network advancements

# 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

* Python

* Pandas, NumPy

* Matplotlib, Seaborn

# 📌 Limitations

* Older records have higher uncertainty

* Station coverage varies over time

* Some depth values are estimated
